# AztecDomino
BA-thesis from maths
Project was part of BA thesis from maths. Algorithm creates aztec domino (random aztec diamond), more here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztec_diamond. We use 2 variables on input. 1st is radius (I suggest using 6-25), 2nd is number of iterations (I suggest choosing number greater than milion :) ). It was written, when i didn't know object programming :)
and I chose pascal language.Now it's funny ;)
